# Project: YouGPT App Implementation

**Objective**: Implement your group's unique idea for a Large Language Model application by modifying and using the provided code on Google Colab.

**Materials Needed**: Laptops or tablets with internet access, Google accounts, knowledge of Python, Google Colab, and APIs.

**Activity Procedure**:

1. Review the Code):
First, have each group review the code provided in the Google Colab link. Make sure they understand how the code works, what each section does, and how it might be modified to suit their unique application.

2. Plan Your Modifications :
Based on their application idea from the previous activity, each group should plan how they need to modify the provided code. What new functions or features do they need to implement? How can the existing code be repurposed for their needs?

3. Implement Your App :
Next, have each group implement their app in Google Colab. They should follow their plan to modify the provided code, testing their app regularly to ensure it's working as expected.

4. Test Your App :
Once their app is implemented, each group should thoroughly test it to make sure it functions correctly and as expected. They should look for any bugs or issues, and make any necessary fixes.

5. Presentation :
Have each group present their implemented app to the class. They should demonstrate its functionality, explain how they modified the provided code, and discuss any challenges they faced and how they overcame them.
