# Project: Design Your Own GPT App

**Objective**: Think up and create a mockup for a unique application of a large language model (like GPT) that solves a specific problem or fills a particular niche.

Materials Needed: Laptops or tablets, Internet access, Gamma.app platform for website creation

**Activity Procedure:**
1. Identify the Unique Niche Problem:
In your groups, brainstorm a unique problem that could potentially be solved using a large language model. Try to make it as specific as possible. Discuss and select the best idea from your brainstorm.

2. Capturing Unique Data:
How could you gather unique and useful data for your chosen problem? Develop a strategy for data collection and list possible sources. Keep in mind the ethical considerations in data collection and usage. **Find at least 5 PDF files that contains data about your idea.**

3. Training a Superior AI Model:
Now, think about how you might train your AI model to solve your chosen problem. Discuss and plan how you would use your data to train the model.

4. Crafting a User-Friendly Interface:
Using the Gamma.app platform, create a mockup of a user-friendly website for your application. Consider what features and functions it would need, and how to make it intuitive and easy to use.

5. Implementing a Subscription Business Model:
Plan a business model for your application. How much would you charge users? How would they pay? How would you handle free trials or freemium features?

6. Hustle to Acquire 10 Initial Customers:
Create a marketing plan for your application. How would you attract and retain your first ten customers? Discuss potential marketing channels and strategies.

7. Iterate and Pivot until Reaching Product-Market Fit:
Identify potential challenges or barriers to success for your application. How would you pivot or adapt to meet these challenges? Discuss ways to incorporate user feedback and continuously improve your product.

8. Scaling Up:
Discuss how you could scale your application if it achieves product-market fit. Where could you find new customers? How could you expand or adapt your product to serve them?

Presentation (20 minutes):
At the end of the activity, each group will present their application idea, user interface mockup, and business model to the class. Encourage constructive feedback and questions.
